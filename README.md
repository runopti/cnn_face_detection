Implementation of the paper: "A Convolutional Neural Network Cascade for Face Detection"

The paper pdf is located [here](http://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2015/papers/Li_A_Convolutional_Neural_2015_CVPR_paper.pdf). 

This is a part of the project that was originally conducted during my summer internship in 2015 at Yale Graphics Group. My task was to improve a face detection method which was used in [Photogrammar project](http://photogrammar.yale.edu/).
